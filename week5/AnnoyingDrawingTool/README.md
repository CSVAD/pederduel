My tool is has changeable parameters to make it as hard/annoying as possible or as eazy as possible. It has varying degrees of 
randomness for three different parameters: Noise (how much the line deviates from the users input), Color (generates random colors 
for each brush stroke) and Weight (randomly varying stroke width for each brush stroke).
