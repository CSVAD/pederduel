## Reading reflection week 5

I really like Bret Victor's vision of making dynamic art a visual artform rather than relying on programming skills. 
I think art, dynamic art in this case, becomes more natural for the artist if it is made the same way it is perceived, visually. This 
also applies for written art, (novels, short storys, poems etc.) but here writing is the medium of choice. I would really 
love to see a mix of the two, a complete animated movie (with animation on par with Pixar) where everything is rendered and all the 
voices performed live, kind of like a play.
