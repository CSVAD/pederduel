Designed to be as simple as possible wihout being too predictive. The design is intended for people who want to find colors they 
wouldn't have picked out themselves. Exploration is the only purpose of this color picker/explorer. Focused mostly on ease of
use, i.e., changing the random values with a mouse click.
