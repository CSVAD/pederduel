# Some Reflections on Designing Construction Kits for Kids

This really makes me wonder why programming hasn't been universally included in elemtary school learning curriculum yet. It seems like
all the right information and guidelines are there to make kids learn to think like a programmer and actually enjoy it. I like the 
priciple, "Give people what they want, not what they ask for", as this resonates with earlier projects I have worked on. The customers 
aren't always sure what they want, so you, as the developer, have to give them a blend of what is feasible, what is wanted by the customer 
and what actually makes a difference.

# Learnable Programming

Bret is really going in the right direction when it comes to learning by doing/learning by visualizing. I truly believe the vast majority of
new programmers will learn better by having these tools from the beginning, and not only that, I think it will make less people scared of
programming and actually wanting to learn. I believe these learning tools, or at least the principles, surely will become the standard for 
learning how programming works and how to think like a programmer.

# Extending Manual Drawing Practices with Artist-Centric Programming Tools

Not unlike one of Bret's visions, DB takes the programming aspect and puts it as a reaction to external inputs. As this is a more art
centered tool, it may make artists that traditionally never would touch programming, actually find it useful and interesting.
