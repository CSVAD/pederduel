## Challenges
I tried to make a replica of a character design I drew one year ago. It was challenging since I didn't have access to an eraser while using
the program so I had to draw everything in one try, or I'd have to start all over. Using the mouse as a pen is not easy! I think it turned 
out OK though.

Shading was basically impossible. I would have to be a master cross-hatcher with the mouse to pull that off.

## Expressive opportunities
The DrawEraseTemplate from DrawingManager didn't really offer that many expressive opportunities. It limited them more than anything. With
that in mind, I knew I had to make adjustments by hand after the plotter was done. When drawing digitally I therefore decided not to do any fine 
detail work and kept the plotter drawing relatively simple. After plotting I added some finer lines, filling and shading by hand.
