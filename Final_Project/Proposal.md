# Idea nr. 1: Paint clone
For idea nr. 1 I am thinking of making a "Paint clone" with my own custom made brushes and functionality. The basic functionality of Paint
should still be present, like undo, erase, fill, select etc.

# Idea nr. 2: Motion capture art
Using the web cam I would like to make a program that can capture images of things in motion. The user can set parameters for different
effects and art styles.
I have never worked with motion capture before and it is something I have wanted to explore for a while, so I think this is what I am 
going to choose.
