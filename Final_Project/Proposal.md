# Art Booth
Photo booth with customizable brushes, textures,
themes. User can choose between many ways of capturing
an image or recording a video. One such way might
be to take a picture every time the webcam detects a smile.

I want to integrate ControlP5 so the user can change the parameters
however they like in real time. This includes background, borders,
alpha, capture method, agents (behaviour, color, number, style) and 
possibly others.

I also want to make it possible for the user to change certain parameters
with voice or gesture commands. For example changing the brightness of
the background corresponding to voice pitch.

A challenge will be to make it fast enough to support smooth real time 
parameter adjustment. Using gestures to capture images/videos will also be
challenging.
